# Autonomous Drone and Human Collaboration Use Case: UPPAAL Model

## Overview
This artifact provides an UPPAAL model for an autonomous drone designed to collaborate with a human in a shared environment. The model ensures the drone's behavior adheres to social norms and safety rules for safe and predictable interaction. 
### Scenario
This model simulates a scenario where an autonomous drone performs a "cutting" task across several locations (plants position) in a shared environment with a human. The drone must complete its mission while dynamically adjusting its behavior based on the human's position and commands.

- **Task**: Drone performs a cutting task across several locations.
- **Human Interaction**: A human collaborator moves and issues commands.
- **Focus**: Social compliance and technical correctness.

## System Components
- **Drone**: States for moving, signaling, cutting, and responding to commands.
- **Human**: Moves and issues halt commands.
- **Observer Automata**: Monitors verifying adherence to social and safety rules.

## Modeled Requirements: Social and Safety Norms

### Rule 1: Prohibition on Cutting Near a Human
- **Norm**: Drone must not cut when human is at the same location.
- **Importance**: Ensures physical safety.
- **Pattern**: Prohibition Observer Pattern.
- **Verification**: `A[] !obs.ErrorState`.

### Rule 2: Prohibition of Intimidating Speed
- **Norm**: Drone must reduce speed when approaching human.
- **Importance**: Ensures psychological comfort.
- **Pattern**: Prohibition Observer Pattern.
- **Verification**: `A[] !obs4.ErrorState`.

### Rule 3: Mandatory Signaling on Resuming Task
- **Norm**: Drone must signal before resuming task after a halt.
- **Importance**: Ensures predictability.
- **Pattern**: Timed Obligation Observer Pattern.
- **Verification**: `A[] !obs2.ErrorState`.

### Rule 4: Graceful Response to Halt Commands
- **Norm**: Drone must wait before resuming after a halt command.
- **Importance**: Ensures controlled interaction.
- **Pattern**: Timed Prohibition Pattern.
- **Verification**: `A[] !obs3.ErrorState`.

## Artifact Structure
- **File**: `HumanCollaboration.xml` containing the UPPAAL model.

## Prerequisites
- UPPAAL IDE (version 4.1 or newer).

## How to Run the Artifact

### Step A: Simulating the System's Behavior
1. Launch UPPAAL IDE.
2. Open `HumanCollaboration.xml`.
3. Navigate to the Simulator tab.
4. Step through or run a random simulation.
5. Observe social norms in action.

### Step B: Verifying the Properties
1. Navigate to the Verifier tab.
2. Check the pre-loaded queries:
   - `A[] !obs.ErrorState`
   - `A[] !obs4.ErrorState`
   - `A[] !obs2.ErrorState`
   - `A[] !obs3.ErrorState`
3. Click the Check button for each property.

**Expected Outcome**: All properties are satisfied, confirming compliance with social and safety rules.
